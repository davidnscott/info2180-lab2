		 <p1>One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found 
		 himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin. He lay on his 
		 armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown
		 belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding
		 was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. His 
		 many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved 
		 about helplessly as he looked. "What's happened to me?" he thought. It wasn't
		 a dream. His room, a proper human room although a little too small, lay 
		 peacefully between its four familiar walls. A collection of textile samples 
		 lay spread out on the table - Samsa was a travelling salesman - and above it 
		 there hung a picture that he had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine 
		 and housed in a nice, gilded frame. It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat
		 and fur boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fur muff that covered the whole 
		 of her lower arm towards the viewer. Gregor then turned to look out the window
		 at the dull weather. Drops<br><br>
